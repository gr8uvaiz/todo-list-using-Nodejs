I started my Node.js journey by creating this dynamic to-do list application using Node.js, MongoDB, and EJS. This project showcases my initial exploration into the world of Node.js and web development. ðŸŒ±

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Easily add tasks to your to-do list.
- **Mark as Completed**: Check off completed tasks.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks you no longer need.
- **Dynamic Rendering**: Utilizes EJS to render tasks dynamically.
